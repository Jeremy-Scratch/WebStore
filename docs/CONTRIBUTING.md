# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. A quick guide to get you started.

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-change
```

2. Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Code style:

- Use TypeScript and follow the existing patterns in `src/`.
- If an ESLint or formatter is configured, run it before committing.

4. Open a PR with a clear title and description. Link related issues and include screenshots if the change affects UI.

5. Maintenance notes for reviewers:

- Keep changes focused and avoid refactoring unrelated code in the same PR.
