## Project structure

- `index.html` — app entry HTML
- `src/main.tsx` — React entry
- `src/App.tsx` — root component
- `src/components/` — UI components (navbar, hero, carousels, footer, etc.)
- `src/hooks/` — custom hooks (carousel logic)
- `src/data/` — sample data objects (gamesObjects)
- `public/` — static assets

See `docs/Components.md` and `docs/Architecture.md` for details about components and architecture.

## Development notes

- Components are organized by feature (e.g., `carousel/feature`, `carousel/hero`).
- Use the `hooks/carouselLogic.tsx` hook to understand carousel behavior and state handling.
